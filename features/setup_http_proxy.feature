Feature: I want to setup the HTTP proxy

   Scenario: I want to test the proxy setup
      Given I am on the Admin page
        And I should see a "HTTP Proxy Hostname" text
        And I should see a "HTTP Proxy Username" text
        And I should see a "HTTP Proxy Password" text
       When I enter "galaxy-proxy.suse.de:3128" as "HTTP Proxy Hostname"

        And I enter "P4$$word" as "HTTP Proxy Password"
